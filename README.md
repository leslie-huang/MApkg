# MApkg
My first R package: custom functions for my MA thesis analysis

I am in the process of refactoring the sentiment analysis I performed as part of my MA thesis analysis (https://github.com/leslie-huang/MA-thesis-analysis).

I wrote many functions as part of that analysis; I am collecting them in an R package here.

To install:

Install and load the `devtools` R package.

Run `devtools::install_github("leslie-huang/faRc-sentiment-analysis-library")`
